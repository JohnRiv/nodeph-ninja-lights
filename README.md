===================

Playing around with Ninja Blocks &amp; Philips Hue at node.ph's Philly Tech Week event.

- Opening a door will turn the Ninja Block's eyes red, change the Philips light to red & flash it, and take a photo from a webcam on the local network & upload it to dropbox
- Pushing a button will do the same but with blue & only flash the Philips light once.

Start the app with

    $ node app.js

This code was quickly hacked together using https://github.com/thatguydan/nodeph-sample-app as a base. It's not the prettiest, but it works.
